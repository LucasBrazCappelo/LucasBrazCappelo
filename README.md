### Hi! I'm Lucas Braz, a fifth year engineering student on Master's exchange at EPFL.
[<img align="left" alt="My Linkedin" width="22px" src="linkedin.svg" />](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-braz-cappelo/) **I'm Looking for a 3 to 9 months internship starting in September 2022 as a end
of studies project.**   
*Willing to relocate in Europe, Switzerland, US or Canada*.  

I'm deeply passionated by Artificial Intelligence and it's transversal applications especially multi-agent simulations and computer vision.   
More generally, I am interested in epistemology and sciences, I enjoy math, algorithmic problems and simulation modeling.   
I intend to work as a Deep Learning Research Engineer.  

#### Here are some projects that I have done:
- [ML_EPFL_Project_2](www.github.com/LucasBrazCappelo/ML_EPFL_Project_2)

A Convolutional Neural Network in Pytorch to perform semantic segmentation of roads on satellite images.  
My first Pytorch project, after some personal classification projects using numpy where I implemented all BackProp computations by matrix calculation with Numpy.   
We obtained good results by implementing a variation of the famous U-Net, very efficient for semantic classification.

- A second year AI project about Autonomous Vehicules

Using Unity for simulation, we trained cars (a little Fully-Connected Neural Network) to complete a circuit.  
We launched 100 independent cars (and their network) by round and we calculated their score according to the distance covered on the course and their time.
We used a genetic algorithm for optimization phase, .  
The results were very satisfactory, with a good convergence, we quickly reached the end of the circuit. By saving the best network and reintroducing it in a new circuit, it obtained good results too, thus letting appear a good generalization.

- A personal project of video game on Super Nintendo coded directly in assembly.  

I was very enthusiastic to realize this project as soon as I had some basic knowledge in assembler, thus realizing one of my oldest dream and allowing me to understand at the lowest level how my favorite game console works.  
It was necessary to understand from scratch the machine language (65C816) and the functioning of the exchanges between CPU, different memories and graphics chip, challenging but very exciting. Big thanks to the people who still make documentation available on the internet.

- [Maze Solver](https://github.com/Maxlo24/Project_CPP_4ETI)

A C++ and Qt project of Maze generation and solving with different exploration algorithms implemented.

**But also, in bulk (not exhaustive)**: Simulations of physical phenomena by PDE and ODE, a small project of 3D game on GPU with OpenGL in C++, image denoising, image compression, a multithreaded Game of Life of Conway project in Python (Tk), a project of Data Analysis accessible [here](https://kallebju.github.io/ada-website/), a front-end website accessible [here](https://github.com/MathieuLeclercq/site-de-voyage), a Space Invaders Game in Python (Tk) accesible [here](https://github.com/MathieuLeclercq/Space-Invaders-)...   
   
I am **currently working on other projects**, such as a **movie recommendation algorithm** project in Scala and a Data Science project on large databases with **PySpark**. I am also **starting a Reinforcement Learning project**. *I will add these projects here when they will be completed.*
